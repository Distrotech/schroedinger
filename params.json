{"name":"Schroedinger","tagline":"Mirror of git://diracvideo.org/git/schroedinger.git","body":"\r\nSchroedinger\r\n============\r\n\r\nSchroedinger (or \"schro\" for short) is an implementation of the\r\nDirac and SMPTE VC-2 video compression specification.  Dirac was\r\ndeveloped by BBC Research & Development (http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/)\r\nas an open technology with open licensing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchroedinger is the C library implementing video encoding and\r\ndecoding.  Most end users will want to use an application that\r\nuses the Schroedinger library for encoding and decoding Dirac\r\nstreams.  A few such applications are Totem, VLC, and Mplayer.\r\nIn addition, media frameworks such as GStreamer and decoding\r\nlibraries such as ffmpeg can be configured to use Schroedinger\r\neither internally or via plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchroedinger requires Orc (the Oil Runtime Compiler) in order to\r\nprocessing.  Orc is a library that generates SIMD code at runtime\r\nbased on simple rules and configurable parameters.  Information\r\nabout Orc can be found here:\r\n\r\n  http://code.entropywave.com/projects/orc/\r\n\r\n\r\nSchroedinger uses pkg-config both for finding Orc, and for allowing\r\nother build systems to find it.  If you are having trouble with\r\nconfigure scripts not finding Orc or Schroedinger, you probably need\r\nto set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable (substitute /usr/local\r\nas necessary):\r\n\r\n  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\r\n\r\n\r\nSchroedinger has a mailing list:\r\n\r\n  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/schrodinger-devel\r\n\r\n  (Note that this is spelled with just an \"o\" instead of \"oe\" or\r\n   o-umlaut \"รถ\".)\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb site:  http://diracvideo.org/\r\n\r\nDownload:  http://diracvideo.org/download/schroedinger/\r\n\r\nGit repository:  http://diracvideo.org/git?p=schroedinger.git;a=summary\r\n\r\nIRC Channel: #dirac at freenode.net\r\n\r\nBug tracking:  send mail.  bugzilla is down and not missed.\r\n\r\nMaintainer: David Schleef <ds@entropywave.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
